1. Please use VS version 15.9.8, I have noticed on some lower versions there could be a build error around package reference.
2. The InterviewHelper file is updated with each commit to providing information about why and how I designed and coded that way.
3. Use the latest version of Postman to test the API. The earlier version had a bug regarding attaching content into the body part for a GET request.
